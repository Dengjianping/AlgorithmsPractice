2. 2012.7-now. Working as test engineer, 
1. ROME porting, then as one of contact after ROME abandoned, actually which is developed by american collegues
    written by labview, teststand, batch, etc.
2. maintained a couple of automated framework for sometime.
3. written a lite automated framework by python, and built a web server to record test result. front-end is written by bootstrap/jquery, back-end is written by

I love machine learning, computer vision, 
familiar with: python, c/c++, cuda, docker, git, OpenCV
interested in: machine learning/cuda/computer vision.
personal project experience: 1. Use CUDA implement a multi-layers neural network.
    2. Use CUDA implement a convolutional NN algorithm.
    3. implemented a logistic regression/linear regression, KNN/K-means, etc.
    4. Sometimes I implement some computer vision algorithm, like gaussian blur/Canny filter/laplace transformer/sobel/, etc.
