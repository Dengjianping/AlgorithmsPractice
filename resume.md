1. 2011.7-2012.6. Pegatron: Worked as a product engineer, whose role is mainly for maintaining fixtures and verifying software upgrading, and SOP(standard operations).
2. 2012.7-now. National Instruments: Working as test engineer, 
    1. ROME porting, then as one of contact after ROME abandoned, actually which is developed by American colleagues written by labview, teststand, batch, etc.
    2. maintained a couple of automated framework for some time.
    3. written a lite automated framework by python, and built a web server to record test result. front-end is written by bootstrap/jquery, back-end is written by django/postgresql/nginx, actually this server runs on a raspberry pi.
    4. now, continue to maintain a couple of products automated framework, and improve them. schedule automated test, make manual test automated, reduce the sum of manual test cases for maintaining products, etc.
    5. kinds of products like EIP/ECAN/EPS/TSN, I wrote sequences for those products with provided python APIs.
    6. Migrated old ATS framework with the newer one, let new framework call and record ROME result.
I love machine learning, computer vision, 
familiar with: python, c/c++, cuda, docker, git, OpenCV, Bootstrap/Jquery,some basic knowledge of Postgresql
interested in: machine learning/cuda/computer vision.
personal project experience: 
    1. Use CUDA implement a multi-layers neural network.
    2. Use CUDA implement a convolutional NN algorithm.
    3. implemented a logistic regression/linear regression, KNN/K-means, etc.
    4. Sometimes I implement some computer vision algorithm, like Gaussian blur/Canny filter/laplace transformer/sobel filter/, etc.
